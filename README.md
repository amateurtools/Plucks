Introducing: "Plucks" (present progessive verb form of Plucked)

I've made too many changes really but I still want to give credit to SuperRiley64 for the inspiration,
And I'm sure I retained many of their ideas and some of their code. So it's forever known as a Fork, and
open source free software.

much will change, so don't get too comfortable yet.

currently the fine tune is buggy and will be reworked.

also i plan on implementing pitch bend which ought to be really weird.
