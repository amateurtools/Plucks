Introducing: "Plucks" (present progessive verb form of Plucked)

I've made too many changes really but I still want to give credit to SuperRiley64 for the inspiration,
And I'm sure I retained many of their ideas and some of their code. So it's forever known as a Fork, and
open source free software.

Notes:

If an already active MIDI note is played again, instead of additively multplying voices it re-excites that voice's delay line.
This means that it behaves more like a physical piano or harpsichord, etc.
